### Overview:
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a given dataset, focusing on exploring various statistical aspects and deriving insights through visual and quantitative methods. The investigation is conducted using Jupyter notebooks, which provide an interactive environment for data manipulation and visualization.

### Tools Used:
Jupyter Notebooks: For running Python code and visualizing data interactively.
Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seabolin for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations.

### Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
Data Exploration: Utilizes statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationship of variables.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducts statistical tests to validate assumptions and hypotheses about the data.

### Objectives:
To identify trends and patterns that can inform further analysis and decision-making.
To employ statistical tools to test hypotheses and validate data integrity.

### Results:
The findings are documented comprehensively in the Jupyter notebooks, with visualizations and code snippets to support the analysis.
